# Design Challenges

## Problem Statement 1
- Improve jewelry designers’ inventory system of jewelry products and diamonds and gems used in a jewelry piece.

## Design Question
- How can I improve jewelry designers’ organization of their products and record the sourcing of diamonds and gems used in jewelry pieces?

## Impact
- Support jewelry designers and mines who are socially responsible by helping them become more organized to support their ethical practices.

## Solutions
- A content management system that displays photo of jewelry piece, description, material used.
- A cloud service so that it can be accessed remotely.
- Linking the diamonds and gems that are used in a jewelry piece to information about those. For example: carat weight, price per carat, the dealer’s contact information, sourcing information all in a separate sheet.

## Context and Constraints
- Having a system that’s able to support a lot of information and photos of jewelry pieces for reference.
- I work for a jewelry designer and using google docs is very problematic when trying to edit a huge inventory word doc with photos of jewelry pieces.
- I went to a trade show last year in Tucson where two major jewelry designers in over 50 retail stores have not found an effective inventory system for their business.

## Problem Statement 2
- Help jewelry designers provide custom options for jewelry to a mass audience

## Design Question
- How can I help jewelry designers provide custom options for clients online?

## Impact
- Support and promote the individuality of jewelry designers with an emphasis on designers who are socially responsible.

## Solutions
- An interactive ring builder that can be displayed on a website. This can show different gold options and diamond and gem options.

## Context and Constraints
- There are a lot of different ring builders that currently exist.
- Many of the jewelry designers I would serve purchase one-of-a-kind diamonds and gems that would be hard to find an exact replicate from a picture.
