I started by accessing Terminal on my mac and just refreshing my mind about the commands on Terminal. I then installed GitHub on my Mac.

Then, I completed the command line tutorial. Next, I installed Nodes, updated my chrome browser, and then installed Atom. Next, I created a folder on my desktop for the project through Terminal.

Lastly, I created my GitHub account.
